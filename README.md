# Go: Potential Bug - Accessing Map Elements Without Checking for Existence

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in Go involving accessing map elements without checking for key existence.  The code attempts to access the value associated with a key without checking if the key actually exists in the map.  This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential errors in production environments.

## Bug Description

The `bug.go` file contains a simple example where the program tries to access the value associated with the key "a" in a map `m`. While the code compiles and runs without errors, it is problematic because if the key "a" does not exist in the map, the program will still return the default zero value for the map's type (in this case, 0 for integers) instead of signaling an error. This unexpected behavior can lead to difficult-to-debug issues in more complex applications.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.go` file demonstrates a more robust solution. It uses the comma ok idiom to check if the key exists in the map before accessing its value. This prevents unexpected behavior and improves the code's reliability.
